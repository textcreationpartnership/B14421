    _ The sixt Motiue. The Protestants are Iouinianists, and therefore Heretiques, and not Catholiques, euen for this cause.

    _ The seuenth Motiue. The Protestants accommodate their Religion vnto the state, and present time.

    _ The eight Motiue. The Protestants can patiently suffer the articles of the Creede &c. to be violated: but they are seuere in those thinges, that repugne their vtility, or sensuality vvhatsoeuer.

    _ The ninth Motiue. The Protestants do vnconscionably impugne the knovvne, and manifest truth.

    _ The tenth Motiue. The Protestants, for vvant of better meanes to conuince the Catholiques, propose vnto them questions of capitall daunger.

    _ The eleuenth Motiue. The Protestants Manner of proceeding against Catholiques, and Catholique Religion, is absurd in reason, and vnequall in Justice. And hence they are prooued to be Hereticks.

    _ The tvveluth Motiue. The superiour Magistrates amonst the Protestants concurre vvith their subordinates, to suppresse the truth, and to oppresse the patrones therof, against all equity, and conscience.
